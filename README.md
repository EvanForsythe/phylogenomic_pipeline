# phylogenomic_pipeline

Python code for performing a phylogenomic analysis.

Breifly, our code will:
- take fasta files as input
- perform multiple sequence alignment
- perform phylogenetic analysis for each alignment
- tally the topologies of resulting gene trees
- create figure summarizing results
